abstract = {The vorticity-stream function formulation of the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is used to study the effectiveness of the coupled strongly implicit multigrid (CSI-MG) method in the determination of high-Re fine-mesh flow solutions. The driven flow in a square cavity is used as the model problem. Solutions are obtained for configurations with Reynolds number as high as 10,000 and meshes consisting of as many as 257 × 257 points. For Re = 1000, the (129 × 129) grid solution required 1.5 minutes of CPU time on the AMDAHL 470 V/6 computer. Because of the appearance of one or more secondary vortices in the flow field, uniform mesh refinement was preferred to the use of one-dimensional grid-clustering coordinate transformations.}

abstract = {Highly-accurate solutions for the lid-driven cavity flow are computed by a Chebyshev collocation method. Accuracy of the solution is achieved by using a substraction method of the leading terms of the asymptotic expansion of the solution of the Navier–Stokes equations in the vicinity of the corners, where the velocity is discontinuous. Critical comparison with former numerical experiments confirms the high-accuracy of the method, and extensive results for the flow at Reynolds number Re=1000 are presented.}
