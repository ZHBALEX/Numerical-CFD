abstract = {Apart from providing some new experimental data the paper reviews previous investigations concerning fluctuating lift acting on a stationary circular cylinder in cross-flow. In particular, effects of Reynolds number in the nominal case of an infinitely long and nonconfined cylinder in a smooth oncoming flow are discussed. The Reynolds number range covered is from about Re=47 to 2×105, i.e., from the onset of vortex shedding up to the end of the subcritical regime. At the beginning of the subcritical regime (Re≃0.3×103) a spanwise correlation length of about 30 cylinder diameters is indicated, the correlation function being based on near-cylinder velocity fluctuations in outer parts of the separated shear layer. In between Reynolds numbers 1.6×103 and 20×103, an approximate 10-fold increase in the sectional r.m.s. lift coefficient is indicated. This range contains a fundamental change-over from one flow state to another, starting off at Re≃5×103 and seemingly fully developed at Re≃8×103.}

abstract = {The paper presents numerical calculations of laminar vortex-shedding flows past circular and square cylinders for Re ⩽ 5000 in the former and Re ⩽ 300 in the latter case. The calculations were performed by solving the unsteady 2D Navier-Stokes equations with a finite volume method incorporating the third-order-accurate discretization scheme QUICK. The resulting Reynolds number dependence of the Strouhal number and of the drag coefficient is compared with experiments and with previous numerical results, showing good agreement for the lower Reynolds numbers at which fully laminar flow can be expected (Re < 1000). For higher Reynolds numbers the calculations deviate from the measurements, and this is blamed on the beginning influence of stochastic fluctuations. For the circular cylinder the time development of the flow towards periodic vortex shedding is illustrated by a series of streamline pictures, and for both geometries the time development of a number of important flow parameters is also presented and discussed.}

abstract = {Results of numerical simulations are presented for flow past a stationary circular cylinder at low Reynolds numbers (Re=50–200). The simulations were carried out using a finite-volume code employing a fractional step method with second-order accuracy in both space and time. A sensitivity study on numerical parameters concerning the domain size, grid independence and time step resolution was carried out in detail for Re=100. Global time-averaged results on force coefficients, non-dimensional velocities and pressures, including their corresponding r.m.s. values, as well as various quantities related to the separation and vortex shedding characteristics are presented. A non-monotonous streamwise velocity recovery in the intermediate wake is observed for Re>50, a phenomenon that has been grossly overlooked in the past. There are two plateaus along the wake centerline, in particular for Re=200. The first, which is the most distinct, ranges from about x=9 to x=16 at a wake deficit velocity of 0.38, x being counted in diameters behind the cylinder axis; the second one appears from x=25 to x=28 at a wake deficit velocity of 0.54. This phenomenon seems to be related to an associated change-over in the orientation of the von Kármán vortices and the merging trends, especially for Re=200 beyond x=25, as observed from instantaneous vorticity fields. Three-dimensional simulations using spanwise lengths of 10 and 12 (diameters) were carried out at Re=200. After a long initial phase with regular three-dimensional mode A flow features increasing very slowly in amplitude, the flow went into a state with distinct pulsating forces acting on the cylinder, the pulsations being seemingly randomly localized across the cylinder span. In this second, much more chaotic, flow state, the time-averaged results were in agreement with previous experiments and with parts of previous numerical studies.}
